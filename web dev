                Iron Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                Co-created by writer and editor Stan Lee, developed by scripter Larry Lieber, 
                and designed by artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in Tales 
                of Suspense #39 in 1962 (cover dated March 1963) and received his own title with Iron 
                Man #1 in 1968. Shortly after his creation, Iron Man became a founding member of the
                 superhero team, the Avengers, alongside Thor, Ant-Man, the Wasp, and the Hulk. 
                 Iron Man stories, individually and with the Avengers, have been published consistently since the character's creation.
